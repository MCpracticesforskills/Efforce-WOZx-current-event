        <h2>WOZX Is Here and It's a Big Deal for Energy Efficiency Projects World Wide</h2>
        <p>
            Efforce has partnered with Steve Wozniak to launch a new cryptocurrency. It's called WOZX, and it's helping fund
            energy efficiency projects worldwide. The coin launched in December of 2020. It gained momentum on the market quickly, shooting up to
            as much as 3 dollars per share.

            As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with
            some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually
            conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or
            some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
