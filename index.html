    <h1>WOZX Is Here and It's a Big Deal for Energy Efficiency Projects World Wide</h1>

    <h3>"<a href="efforce.io">Efforce</a>
        is the first platform that allows contributors to benefit from the energy savings generated by energy
        efficiency projects worldwide."</h3>

        <h2>The Environment Needs Our Help</h2>
        <p>
            The next item on the world’s political agenda is energy efficiency. We have to save the environment. We’ve seen
            politicians like Al Gore repeat this mantra to ad nauseam (Gore made numerous environmental predictions that were
            horribly wrong but let’s not go down that road). <a href="https://www.projectveritas.com/">Project Veritas</a> even caught CNN Technical Director Charlie Chester saying CNN will be using
            propaganda to push climate change awareness (again, let me stop myself here.) Whether you believe the climate is in dire
            straits or not, we can all agree the environment needs our help.

        </p>
    <h2>Efforce is a Crowdfunding Platform for Energy Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
        With the global population growing at an exponential rate, it is vital that both public and private industry do their
        part to save the environment. That’s where Efforce comes in. Efforce is a company that provides a platform. Their
        platform lists energy efficiency projects for investors and businesses who are looking to fund energy efficiency
        projects. These projects increase a company’s efficiency while saving the environment. The amount of energy saved (aka
        megaWoz just like megawatts except with a cleaver name) is then recorded using smart meters. The more energy a company
        saves, the more megaWoz they generate. The megaWoz is then distributed back to the company and the investors. 
        

        </p>
    <h2>What Does the Energy Efficiency Process Look Like?</h2>
        <p>
            Still not comprehending? Don’t worry. Efforce is the first company to attempt using Blockchain technology,
            cryptocurrency, and energy efficiency in this unique way. Let me give a solid example. Company A needs to re-lamp their
            warehouse and switch from gas to nuclear power, but Company A doesn’t have enough money to do it on their own. So,
            Company A lists their project (re-lamping and nuclear power needs) with Efforce. Investors see the project. Investors
            invest in project. Project is completed. Company A gets new lamps in their warehouse; they function off of nuclear
            power. The day is saved. Now, all the energy Company A saves is documented on the Blockchain, and each megawatt is
            converted into WOZX. WOZX is then distributed back to Company A and the investors who funded the project.
